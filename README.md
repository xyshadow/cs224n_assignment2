# cs224n_assignment2
My implementation of cs224n assignment 2, only Q2 related codes are implemented.

I added one extra layer of FC layer, and l2 regularization on top of the baseline model.

Here is the results with the extension:

Epoch 10 out of 10
924/924 [==============================] - 6s - train loss: 0.0916        
Evaluating on dev set - dev UAS: 86.45

================================================================================
TESTING
================================================================================
Restoring the best model weights found on the dev set
Final evaluation on test set - test UAS: 87.11
Writing predictions
Done!
